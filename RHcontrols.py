#If these ever need changed, the format for additional labs and temperature controls using a dictionary is: RHcontrols['<building>/<room>'] = [<minimum humidity>, <maximum humidity>]
#Dictionary list of humidity controls. Units are percent relative humidity (0 - 100)
#Add new humidity controls below the last line
